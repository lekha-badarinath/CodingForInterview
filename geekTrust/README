This is the solution for Problem-4 of the GeekTrust coding challenges.

Link to the problem statement - https://www.geektrust.in/coding-problem/backend/cricket

Problem name - CRICKET
Language used - Python
Version - 3.6.8

The programs will run only on python 3.6. Python v2 does not support random.choices() which is the main method needed for these codes 

The first part of the problem - The Toss has also been solved here.

The solution has been divided into three modules - theToss.py, theLastFour.py, theTie.py

Each module has been developed using Object Oriented Programming concepts.

Wherever possible, comments have been added to make the code comprehensible.

Lists and Dictionaries have been used extensively throughout the challenge.

Attempt has been made to make the code as reusable as possible, without compromising the readability of the programs.

A small sleep time of 0.5 seconds has been added at places to make the flow of the code feel more real-world-like.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************
theTie
	-input must be given as a phrase (eg. - Clear Day/Cloudy Night)
	-for inputs where the team's preference is not clear, the winning team will always bat.

theLastFour
	-inputs will be simulated from within the program. There is no need for any user inputs.
	-the random.choices() method will generate the inputs.

theTie
	-inputs will be simulated from within the program. There is no need for any user inputs.
	-the random.choices() method will generate the inputs.
	-Winner will be decided after comparing the final scores of both the teams.
